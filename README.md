# Container_Forecast
A data project of forecasting container statistics at the Port of Vancouver.
1. Cleaning data from pdf published by [Port of Vancouver](https://www.portvancouver.com/reports-and-resources).
2. Establish prophet forecasting models for parameters.

## Tools
- Prophet
- tabula
- matplotlib

## Results
Best model has the mininum testing mean absolute error over 12 months prediction.

## TODOs
The future TODOs are about automation the forecasting to the remaining metrics, writing functions of code snippet on data cleaning and modelling, deploy an end-to-end model in any cloud platform, such as AWS or Microsoft Fabric. A draft plan is listed in the following steps:

1. Data Pipeline and Database
    - Monthly download pdf file from [Port of Vancouver](https://www.portvancouver.com/reports-and-resources)
    - Validate data according to data quality metrics
    - Automatically or mannully clean data
    - Add incremental data to database
2. Training and Forecast
    - Split the data by recent 1 year data as testing data and remaining data as training data
    - Add major events as holiday data in prior.
    - Tuning Models with parameters like model 2 and model 3
    - Find the optimal parameters
    - Training the model with optimal parameters and all testing and training data
    - Forecast the future 1 year data
    - Add prediction data to database
3. Publish and Visualization
    - Deploy monthly updated dashboard with forecasted value
    - Generate report and draw insights about the value
    - Publish dashboard

There are also other TODOs:
1. Try other modelling techniques, such as techniques shown in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cabaxiom/s5e1-previous-years-baseline-no-model#Disaggregating-Total-Sales-Forecast).
2. Develop other models, such as [NeuralProphet](https://medium.com/@cuongduong_35162/facebook-prophet-in-2023-and-beyond-c5086151c138), [Explainable Forecasting at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15397?fbclid=IwAR2vCkHYiy5yuPPjWXpJgAJs-uD5NkH4liORt1ch4a6X_kmpMqagGtXyez4).
3. Try [model combination](https://otexts.com/fpp3/combinations.html).
